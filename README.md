# A screensaver, tailored for my folder of spaceflight images.

This python program shows random images (or stills from videos), and shows their path in a textbox for context.

Settings (e.g. which directories to be searched and to be excluded) are stored in `Appdata/Local/Jonathan's Programma's/SpaceScreensaver`.
