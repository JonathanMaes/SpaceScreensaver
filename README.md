This python program functions as a screensaver.
It shows random images, or stills from videos, and shows their path in a textbox.
The directories to be searched and to be excluded, and other settings, are stored in Appdata/Local/Jonathan's Programma's/SpaceScreensaver.
This is tailored to work well for my folder of spaceflight images.This is a screensaver that shows random images with set intervals, and shows their metadata on screen as well.
